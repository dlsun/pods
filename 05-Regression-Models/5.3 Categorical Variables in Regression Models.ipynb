    "\n",
    "So far, we have fit linear and $k$-nearest neighbors regression models to data where all of the features are quantitative. But what if all or some of the features are categorical? In theory, the solution is simple: we simply transform the categorical variables into quantitative variables using dummy (i.e., one-hot) encoding, following the process in Chapter 3. However, in practice, some care is needed to ensure that the categorical variables are transformed in a consistent way between the training and the test data."
