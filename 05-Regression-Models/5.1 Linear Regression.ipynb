        "In 1991, Orley Ashenfelter, an economics professor at Princeton University, stunned the wine world with a bold prediction. He predicted that the 1990 vintage of Bordeaux wines would be the \"wine of the century,'' even better than the prized 1961 vintage. Furthermore, he made this prediction without tasting even a drop of the wine, which had been placed in oak barrels just months earlier.\n",
        "\n",
        "How did Ashenfelter predict the quality of the wine without tasting it? He used data on past vintages to come up with the following formula for predicting wine quality:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{align}\n",
        "    \\widehat{\\text{wine quality}} = -7.8 &+ 0.62 \\cdot (\\text{average summer temperature}) \\nonumber \\\\\n",
        "    &+ 0.0012 \\cdot (\\text{winter rainfall}) \\nonumber \\\\\n",
        "    &- 0.0037 \\cdot (\\text{harvest rainfall}) \\nonumber \\\\\n",
        "    &+ 0.024 \\cdot (\\text{age of the wine})\n",
        "    \\label{eq:ashenfelter}\n",

        "\n",
        "The variable on the left-hand side of this expression, wine quality, is what we are trying to predict and is called \n",
        "the _target_ (or _label_). (The hat symbol over  \"wine quality\" indicates that the values are predicted instead of observed.) The variables on the right-hand side, such as \"average summer temperature\" and \"harvest rainfall,\" are called _features_ and are the inputs used to predict the target. Although Ashenfelter had no way of knowing the quality of the 1990 wines, he did have the values of the features in 1990, so to make a prediction, all he had to do was plug those values into the equation above. In this way, he arrived at the following prediction for the quality of the 1990 Bordeaux, after they had been aged for 31 years (like the 1961 Bordeaux had been at the time):\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{align}\n",
        "    -7.8 &+ 0.62 \\cdot (18.7) \\nonumber \\\\\n",
        "    &+ 0.0012 \\cdot (468) \\nonumber \\\\\n",
        "    &- 0.0037 \\cdot (80) \\nonumber \\\\\n",
        "    &+ 0.024 \\cdot (31) = 4.8.  \\label{eq:ashenfelter_1990}\n",
        "\\end{align}\n",
        "\n",
        "For comparison, the quality of the prized 1961 vintage was 4.6.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can imagine the uproar from wine experts, who had spent years refining their palates to distinguish good wines from bad. Robert Parker, the most influential wine critic in America, called Ashenfelter's predictions \"ludicrous and absurd\", comparing him to a \"movie critic who never goes to see the movie but tells you how good it is based on the actors and the director.\" It did not help that Ashenfelter had also openly challenged Parker's rating of the 1986 Bordeaux. Parker thought they would be \"very good and sometimes exceptional.\" But according to Ashenfelter's formula, the low summer temperatures and high harvest rainfalls in 1986 doomed the vintage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Who was right? Thirty years later, Robert Parker ranks the 1986 Bordeaux well, but the 1990 Bordeaux wines are exceptional, with three of the six wines scoring a 98 on a 100-point scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lesson, we will reproduce Ashenfelter's analysis, which is an example of _machine learning_. Machine learning is concerned with the general problem of how to use data to make predictions. The process of producing a model like Ashenfelter's from data is called _fitting_ a model (although the terms _training_ or _learning_ are also used), and the data that is used to fit the model is the\n",
