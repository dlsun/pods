This stereotype exists for a reason; many real-world data sets can indeed be organized this way. Data that can be represented using rows and columns is called _tabular data_. The rows are also called _observations_ or _records_,  while the columns are called _variables_ or _fields_. The different terms reflect the diverse communities within data science, and their origins are summarized in the table below.\n",

A `DataFrame` is optimized for storing tabular data; for example, it uses the fact that the values within a column are all the same type to save memory and speed up computations. Unfortunately, the `DataFrame` is not built into base Python, a reminder that Python is a general-purpose programming language. To be able to work with `DataFrame`s, we have to import a data science package called `pandas`, which essentially does one thing---define a data structure called a `DataFrame` for storing tabular data. But this data structure is so fundamental to data science that importing `pandas` is the very first line of many Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts:"
