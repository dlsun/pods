We can visualize each vector as an arrow in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension represents a word. The magnitude of the vector along a dimension represents the \"frequency\" (TF or TF-IDF) of that word in the document. For example, if our vocabulary only contains two words, \"i\" and \"sam\", then the arrows shown below might represent two documents:\n",
