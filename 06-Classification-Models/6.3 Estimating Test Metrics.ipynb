        "In the previous lesson, we learned several scores (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) for evaluating classification models. We calculated these scores on the training data---that is, the same data that was used to evaluate the model. In Chapter 5, we saw that evaluating machine learning models on the training data is problematic because a machine learning model can achieve a good training score by _overfitting_ to the training data. We argued that the goal of a machine learning model should be to achieve a good score on test data. (Chapter 5.4) However, ground truth labels are often not available for the test data. Nevertheless, we can use cross-validation on the training data to estimate the test scores. (Chapter 5.5) These so-called _validation scores_ can be used to select between models and tune hyperparameters. (Chapter 5.6)\n",

        "Although Chapter 5 was about regression models, the exact same program can be carried out for classification models. Instead of calculating the *training* accuracy, precision, etc., we estimate the *test* accuracy, precision, etc. using cross-validation. This lesson demonstrates how to carry out this program, but the concepts (and even the code) are essentially identical to Chapter 5.\n",
