The levels increase in the winter (in the northern hemisphere), peaking around May of each year, and then decline in the summer. Plants are responsible for this seasonal pattern. In the summer months, plants absorb $\\text{CO}_2$ from the atmosphere as part of photosynthesis, in order to grow flowers and leaves. In the winter months, these leaves fall to the ground, where they are broken down by microbes that emit $\\text{CO}_2$ in the process. \n",

To see the overall trend more clearly, we can calculate the yearly average, therefore smoothing over all of the seasonal fluctuations. Although this can be done manually, `pandas` provides a convenience method, `.resample()`, that changes the sampling frequency of the time series. The `.resample()` function works like `.groupby()`; you have to specify a column and an aggregation function. In the code below, we average the **ppm** in each year to obtain a time series with a sampling frequency of 1 year."
