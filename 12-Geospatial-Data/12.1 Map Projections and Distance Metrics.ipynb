    "\n",
    "A map depicts geographic data on a flat, two-dimensional plane. The process of converting a three-dimensional surface to a two-dimensional plane is known as **projection**. There are many possible projections. Every projection distorts the surface in some way, so there is no \"best\" projection. The right projection depends on the situation.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "To obtain a cylindrical projection, we first imagine rolling a flat piece of paper into a cylinder that encloses the Earth. Next, we imagine a source of light emanating from the center from the Earth, projecting each location on the surface of the earth onto the cylinder. The map is just the unrolled cylinder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mercator projection is _conformal_, meaning that it preserves angles. This makes it useful for navigation. The problem with the Mercator projection is that it grossly distorts the sizes of locations near the poles. Canada, Russia, and Greenland appear much bigger than they actually are. Shown below is a comparison of the apparent sizes of Greenland and Africa in the Mercator projection and in actuality.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/greenland-vs-africa.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other projections, the most notable ones being the Gall-Peters projection (a projection that preserves areas exactly) and the Robinson projection (a projection that is neither conformal nor equal-area, but a reasonable compromise between the two).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/projections.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also _conic projections_. That is, locations on the surface of the earth are projected onto a cone instead of a cylinder.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/conic.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The cone can touch the surface of the Earth at one latitude (in which case it is called a \"tangent cone\") or two (in which case it is called a \"secant cone\"). The latitudes at which the cone meets the surface of the Earth are called **reference latitudes**. Distances along the reference latitudes are preserved perfectly. A common conic projection that is used for regional maps is the **Lambert conformal conic** (LCC) projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about map projections, read [Understanding Map Projections](http://downloads2.esri.com/support/documentation/ao_/710Understanding_Map_Projections.pdf). But let's take the projections that we know and start making maps."
